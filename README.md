This Power BI dashboard presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of vehicle insurance claims to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities. Out of 15,000 total claims analyzed, 923 were detected as fraudulent, representing a fraud rate of approximately 5.99%. The visual layout provides deep insights into how fraud correlates with demographic and policy-related variables.

Key highlights include fraud distribution by sex, where male policyholders account for the majority of fraudulent claims (88.62%). Marital status and age also show notable patterns, with married and middle-aged individuals contributing more to the fraud count. The "Top 5 Makes by Fraud Claims Count" chart identifies Pontiac and Toyota as the leading vehicle brands associated with fraudulent claims.

Additionally, the dashboard segments fraud by policy type, showing the highest fraud rates in Sport-Collision and Sedan-All Perils categories. The correlation between vehicle age, vehicle price, and fraud is also visualized, revealing that fraud is more common in moderately priced vehicles aged between 5â€“7 years.

Interactive filters allow users to explore specific segments based on gender, marital status, or age group. This dashboard is ideal for fraud analysts and insurance firms seeking actionable intelligence to enhance fraud detection strategies.
